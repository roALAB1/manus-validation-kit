# GitHub Actions Release Workflow
# 
# IMPORTANT: To use this workflow, you need to manually copy it to .github/workflows/release.yml
# This is because the GitHub App does not have permission to create workflow files.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Copy this file to .github/workflows/release.yml in your repository
# 2. Commit and push the change manually or via GitHub web interface
